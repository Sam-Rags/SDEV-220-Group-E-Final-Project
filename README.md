SDEV220 – Group E Final Project Launch

Step 1: Communication Plan
Importance of Communication:
Establishing effective communication is essential for successful project management. Consistent communication will allow Group E to work cohesively and achieve project milestones.
Primary Communication Tools:
Group E has chosen Discord as the primary tool for group discussions, file sharing, and project updates. Discord provides reliable asynchronous communication, where chat logs can be stored, files uploaded, and video calls held as needed. Additionally, FaceTime will be available for one-on-one discussions if required.
Weekly Meetings:
The team will meet every Wednesday at 6 PM on Discord to discuss project updates, review tasks, and plan next steps. These meetings will ensure that all members stay aligned with the project’s progress and address any challenges that arise.
Project Manager:
A designated Project Manager will oversee communication, coordinate meetings, and monitor task progress. The project manager will ensure the team follows the communication plan and meets scheduled milestones.

    • Intro to Using Discord (Video)

Step 2: Project Description
Project Overview:
After finalizing our communication plan, Group E chose to create a Point of Sale (POS) System designed for online retailers, with functionality tailored to inventory and order management. 
This POS system is intended to improve stock and order management for retailers of all sizes, particularly those in online marketplaces similar to Amazon.com.
Client:
The client is an online retail company that requires efficient inventory tracking and order management. This solution will help small-to-medium-sized businesses streamline their inventory and sales processes.
Scope of the System:
The POS system will:
    1. Track Items: Manage items by name, price, and available quantity.
    2. Order Management: Track customer orders, calculate order totals, and adjust inventory based on sales.
    3. Inventory Management: Track inventory levels for each item and provide alerts for low stock.
The system's scope is feasible within the course duration, focusing on essential POS functions that can be realistically achieved.
Purpose:
This system will assist retailers in:
    • Streamlining Inventory Management: Ensuring accurate stock levels for customer demand.
    • Simplifying Order Processing: Calculating order totals and tracking order statuses.
    • Improving Customer Satisfaction: Minimizing order errors and delays.

Step 3: Project Collaboration
To effectively collaborate, Group E will utilize GitHub’s repository and collaboration features.
GitHub Repository:
The project manager created a GitHub repository named SDEV_220_Final_Project_Group_E. This repository will serve as the central hub for project code, updates, and contributions.
Collaboration Features:
All team members will have access to the repository, either through direct invitation or forking. Members can propose changes via pull requests, ensuring code reviews and quality control before any feature is integrated.
GitHub Resources for Collaboration:
    • Be Social on GitHub
    • Fork a Repo
    • Inviting Collaborators
    • About Pull Requests

Step 4: Project Management and Roles
Group E will implement Agile project management principles by utilizing Kanban Boards on Trello. This board will track each task’s status and assign roles to specific team members.
Trello Board Setup:
A Trello board titled Group E - SDEV220 Project has been created, with columns representing different project stages, including To Do, In Progress, Review, and Completed.
Team Roles and Responsibilities:
To ensure efficient workflow, roles have been assigned to team members as follows:
    1. Sam - Graphical Interface Design:
        ◦ Responsible for designing the POS system's user interface, ensuring an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing layout.
        ◦ Will focus on what users see and interact with during the POS experience.
    2. Isabella - Classes & Back-End Design:
        ◦ Manages the back-end structure, focusing on data storage, retrieval, and class creation for items and orders.
        ◦ Ensures that the back-end supports real-time updates and efficient data management.
    3. Tommy - Feature Implementation:
        ◦ Focuses on integrating features like order tracking, item management, and total calculations.
        ◦ Works closely with the back-end developer to ensure features align with data handling needs.
    4. John - Testing:
